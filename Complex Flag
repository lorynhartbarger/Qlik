//This code was written to create a flag that required fields from two different tables in a data model and an external file
//The DM had a main table where the ClientID and Date lived and a dim table where the ProductID lived
//These two tables were linked together via the OrderID
//The external file had list of combinations of ClientID, Date, and OrderID that indicated a flagged purchace
//The intention of the script is to use the data from the external file to create a flag where the combination exists in the DM
