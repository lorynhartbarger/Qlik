/* How to use these flags in the app to do analysis */

//create a master item for total revenue
Sum(Revenue) //this will be called Total_Revenue 

//create a master item for revenue for the current year using set analysis and master items
{<Date.ThisYear= {'1'}>}Total_Revenue //this will be called Total_Revenue&'_'&year(today()) 
                                      //since the current year is 2023, I will refer to it as Total_Revenue_2023 in further calcs

//create a master item for revenue for the previous year using set analysis and master items
{<Date.LastYear= {'1'}>}Total_Revenue //this will be called Total_Revenue&'_'&(year(today())-1) 
                                      //since the current year is 2023, I will refer to it as Total_Revenue_2022 in further calcs

//create a master item for the difference in revenue from the current year to the prior
[Total_Revenue_2023]-[Total_Revenue_2022] // this will be called Total_Rev_YoY_Dif

//create a master item to find the % difference in revenue from the current year to prior
[Total_Rev_YoY_Dif]/[Total_Revenue_2022] //this will be called %Dif_Rev_YoY

/* Now you can create a KPI for the total revenue of the current year using Total_Revenue_2023
add a subtitle to the kpi using the following script */
If( %Dif_Rev_YoY >0, 'Total Revenue for '&year(today())&' is up by '
&num(%Dif_Ref_YoY, '##.#%')&' (+'&num(Total_Rev_YoY_Dif, '$#,###)
&') compared to '&year(today())-1&'.',
  If( %Dif_Rev_YoY <0, 'Total Revenue for '&year(today())&' is down by '
  &num(%Dif_Ref_YoY, '##.#%')&' (-'&num(Total_Rev_YoY_Dif, '$#,###)
  &') compared to '&year(today())-1&'.',
    If( %Dif_Rev_YoY =0, 'Total Revenue has not shifted compared to '&year(today())-1&'.')

/*This would possible result in a kpi subtitle saying:
Total Revenue for 2023 is up by 1.5% (+$10,576) compared to 2022.
This logic can be applied using any of the flags we created above. 
You can look at last completed month to the previous or the same month of the previous year for example */
